# How to create a campaign of simulations ?

## 1. Prepare your JSON

With the interactive console:
 
 ```
 user@instant-contiki:rpl-attacks>> make_all sample-attacks
 ```

Or with Fabric:

 ```
 ../rpl-attacks$ fab prepare:test-campaign
 ```
 
 When generating the campaign JSON, the framework will fill the docstrings at the beginning of the file with some useful information about available items, namely:
 
 - Building-blocks
 - Root mote types (the C files prefixed with `root-` in `[FRAMEWORK_FOLDER]/templates/experiment/motes/`)
 - Sensor mote types (the C files prefixed with `sensor-` in `[FRAMEWORK_FOLDER]/templates/experiment/motes/`)
 - Malicious mote types (the C files prefixed with `malicious-` in `[FRAMEWORK_FOLDER]/templates/experiment/motes/`)


## 2. Tune the JSON according to the following structure

### With a common topology for all simulations
 
 ```javascript
 {
   "BASE": {
     "simulation": { 
       "[field]": [value],
       ...
     },
     "malicious": {
       "[field]": [value],
       ...
     }
   },
   "[experiment]": {
     "simulation": { 
       "[field]": [value],
       ...
     },
     "malicious": {
       "[field]": [value],
       ...
     }
   },
   [other experiment blocks]
 }
 ```
 
**BASE**: (mandatory)
 
 > **simulation**
 >
 >  **Field** | **Value**
 >  --- | ---
 >  `title` | string
 >  `goal` | string
 >  `notes` | string
 >
 >> Inside the simulation file (.CSC), the text in the SimulationNotes plugin will be generated with the following layout:
 >>
 >> `Goal: [goal]`
 >> 
 >> `[notes]`
 >
 >  **Field** | **Value**
 >  --- | ---
 >  `number-motes` | non-null positive integer (this is the number of non-root motes)
 >  `target` | string amongst the available platforms in `[CONTIKI_FOLDER]/platform/`
 >  `duration` | non-null positive integer, duration in seconds
 >  `debug` | boolean, for printing debug messages of the ContikiRPL library
 >  `repeat` | non-null positive integer, number of simulation repetitions [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET]
 >  `root` | string amongst the suffixes (that is, excluding `root-`) of C files in `[FRAMEWORK_FOLDER]/templates/experiment/motes/`
 >  `sensor` | string amongst the suffixes (that is, excluding `sensor-`) of C files in `[FRAMEWORK_FOLDER]/templates/experiment/motes/`
 >  `minimum-distance-from-root` | non-null positive integer determining the minimal distance *of the malicious mote* from the root
 >  `transmission-range` | positive integer greater than or equal to `minimum-distance-from-root`
 >  `interference-range` | positive integer greater than or equal to `transmission-range`
 >  `area-square-side` | positive integer greater than or equal to `sqrt(2) * minimum-distance-from-root
 >  `wsn-generation-algorithm` | string indicating the WSN topology generation algorithm to be used
 
 > **malicious**: **NOT** present in **BASE**
 >   (the experiments start after the **BASE** definition)


**[experiment]**: (mandatory)
 
 > **simulation**
 >
 >> Here, the same parameters as for **simulation** in **BASE** can be entered. They override these of the **BASE** block.

 > **malicious**
 > 
 >  **Field** | **Value**
 >  --- | ---
 >  `target` | string amongst the available platforms in `[CONTIKI_FOLDER]/platform/`
 >  `type` | string amongst the suffixes (that is, excluding `malicious-`) of C files in `[FRAMEWORK_FOLDER]/templates/experiment/motes/`
 >  `building-blocks` | list of strings amongst the blocks defined in `[FRAMEWORK_FOLDER]/templates/building-blocks.json`
 >  `external-library` | the path to a user-defined RPL library
 >
 >> This means that the malicious mote can be compiled with a platform different than the rest of the WSN.


### With a specific topology for each simulation
 
Same as for the structure with **BASE**, except that this block is not present and each experiment holds a **simulation** section with the same available parameters (if this section is not mentioned, default parameters are used).
